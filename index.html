    <box9p1 class="box9p1">A prominent challenge to museum exhibition designers everywhere is the phenomenon of “museum fatigue.” As early as the 1920s, researchers began to identify this issue, defining it as “a term that characterises decreased visitor interest towards exhibits as visits progress.” Thus, the reason museum fatigue is a problem is due to the influence it has on the extent of visitors’ engagement with exhibits, in turn affecting the amount of learning they are able to do within their time in the museum, as longer exhibit viewing time corresponds to increased learning.</box9p1>

    <box11head4 class="box11head4">Potential Causes</box11head4>
      
    <box12p2 class="box12p2">Researcher Gareth Davey concludes that museum fatigue is theorized to be caused by some interaction between visitor attributes and the museum setting. Two hypotheses currently exist which attempt to account for the cause of museum fatigue: the Visitor Attributes Hypothesis and the Environmental Attributes Hypothesis.<br><br>The Visitor Attributes Hypothesis suggests that factors associated with the visitors themselves are responsible for their decreased interest; factors like physical fatigue and a decrease of cognitive processing ability, as people possess a limited processing capacity which is reached with time and effort, especially after having done one thing for a long period of time. Thus, this hypothesis suggests that museum fatigue is caused by the limited attention capabilities of people. However, the fact that this phenomenon is found in widespread populations across the world suggests that it is not solely the visitors’ attributes which causes this fatigue.<br><br>The Environmental Attributes Hypothesis suggests that it is the peoples’ surroundings, the arrangement of displays and exhibit architecture, which most affects their interest. This hypothesis suggests that environmental attributes, such as that of an open door, certain display arrangements, or attraction of an eye-catching object, are prominent influencers on peoples’ directional flow. Studies done surrounding this hypothesis have shown that structural aspects of exhibition appearances had the most significant effects on visitors’ viewing times.<br><br>Another theory synthesizes these two hypotheses, asserting that they work in tandem because visitors’ cognitive processing,  a visitor attribute, is dependent on interaction with the exhibition design, an environmental factor.</box12p2>
