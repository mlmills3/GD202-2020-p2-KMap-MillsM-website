    <box8p1 class="box8p1">In Western cultures, visitors tend to follow right turns before lefts, and, by extension, often peruse an exhibition in counterclockwise paths, following the right-hand wall; they spend more time in areas of exhibits nearer to the entrance than the exit—though this is less of an obstacle in circular exhibits wherein the entrance also functions as the exit; and that they spend less time at center-island exhibits.</box8p1>

    <box10head2 class="box10head2">Traffic Patterns Observed in the NCMNS</box10head2>
      
    <box11p2 class="box11p2">Foot traffic in each building seems mostly highly concentrated on the lowest floors, and seems to dissipate as floor levels increase. Especially in the Nature Research Center building, as one ascends to higher floor levels, less people are present, and the fourth floor level is often very empty as it houses no exhibits, and exists only as a pathway to enter conference rooms and offices, aside from a small outdoor patio with a few landscaped rocks.<br><br>The main lobbies of the museum seem to have a generally high activity level as visitors enter and exit through the main doors. People also tend to congregate in the lobby areas as they are the most central parts of the museum—those which connect to all other aspects of the space: gift shops, outdoor areas, help desks, main stairwells and elevators, and the actual exhibit areas.<br><br>People often stop by the front desks to ask the employees questions—a sign that the desks are efficient in communicating their purpose to the patrons, and do not appear daunting, but instead, welcoming. In the main lobby of the Nature Research Center, the newer of the two connected buildings which comprise this museum, the foot traffic is high on an event day like that of a Science Olympiad showcase. Even with check-in and activity tables set up in the lobby and different lines set up throughout the area, people seem to navigate through the space with ease, which I assume to mean the signage is fairly effective.</box11p2>
