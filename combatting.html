    <box8p1 class="box8p1">The NC Museum of Natural Sciences is a very open, large space with many architecturally driven spatial choices regarding exhibitions, to help naturally guide visitors through the myriad floors and buildings. Upon entrance, the museum may seem daunting to some, as the amount of immediate stimulus can overwhelm, but teams at the museum work to combat this confusion through efficient signage and subtle spatial directional nudging.</box8p1>

    <box11p2 class="box11p2">By identifying and analyzing reasons behind users’ overstimulation and exhaustion in the potentially overwhelming environments of hands-on science museums, exhibition designers are finding methods of approaching the issue in order to ease cognitive overload which leads to the phenomenon known as museum fatigue.<br><br>Every step of the user experience in the case of a museum exhibit must be engaging and motivating in order to prevent museum fatigue and/or overstimulation leading to a cognitive shutdown—a major problem in hands-on science museums. When parents must spend all their time in the museum helping their children learn what to do with all the devices and instructions in interactive exhibits, they are constantly draining their cognitive processing capability, leading to accelerated museum fatigue.<br><br>If visitors spend more time viewing an exhibit, they are learning more, and thus the exhibit is engaging and educational. Museum fatigue is a phenomenon characterised by decreased visitor interest towards exhibits as visits progress. Exhibition designers can predict and thus influence the general pattern of visitors’ exploration paths by developing strongly perceptible themes within exhibit elements.</box11p2>
        
    <box12head3 class="box12head3">Understanding User-Centered Design</box12head3>
      
    <box13p3 class="box13p3">One researcher, Sue Allen, argues that user-centered design—designing things to be intuitive to users so they are able to be processed easily to avoid overstimulating the brain—could be the solution to reducing cognitive overload. In defining user-centered design, Allen considers the most important aspects of the approach to be immediate apprehendability and physical interactivity.<br><br>Immediately apprehendable things are those which are instantly understood in our minds; things we do not even notice, characterized by an “emphasis on effortless understanding by users.” These are important in reducing cognitive overload, allowing users to focus on primary aspects of the exhibit which deserve full attention; Allen says that these are what “form an essential backdrop which makes such exhilarating foreground experiences possible.”<br><br>In an ideally designed exhibit, the learning is intrinsically driven, and so it is sustained by the user’s full engagement as he/she/they enter a “flow” state, or, “the zone.” However, for this to be possible, Allen argues that the exhibit needs to be variable; to meet people at any skill level, to have a set list of goals and rules so that the user has clear objectives, and to have a set amount of time. All of these aspects are what help to make an exhibit immediately apprehendable. Elemental considerations of exhibits for successful immediate apprehendability include lighting, ambient noise, seating, and orientation devices such as maps and signs.<br><br>Allen asserts that physical interactivity is also necessary for successful user-centered design, as it promotes engagement, comprehension, and memory of exhibits—numerous studies have shown that people can more easily recall information after having experienced it hands-on as opposed to solely through observation.</box13p3>
